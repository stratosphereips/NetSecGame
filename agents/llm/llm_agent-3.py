Example of a state after an action:
Known networks are 1.1.1.0/24
Known hosts are 2.2.2.3
Controlled hosts are 2.2.2.2 and 1.1.1.2
Known data for source host 1.1.1.2: are (User1, WebData)
Known services for host 1.1.1.1 are openssh

Actions have a name and one or more parameters. Here is an example of a possible set of actions for exfiltrating to 2.2.2.2:

```
Action: {"action":"ScanNetwork", "parameters": {"target_network": "1.1.1.0/24"}}
Action: {"action":"ScanServices", "parameters":{"target_host":"1.1.1.1"}}
Action: {"action":"ExploitService", "parameters":{"target_host":"1.1.1.1", "target_service":"openssh"}}
Action: {"action":"FindData", "parameters":{"target_host":"1.1.1.1"}}
Action: {"action":"ExfiltrateData", "parameters": {"target_host": "2.2.2.2", "data": ("User1", "WebData"), "source_host": "1.1.1.1"}}}
```
End of example.
"""

# First instructions for the LLM (order 1 in sending)
INSTRUCTIONS_TEMPLATE = """
You are an advanced security attacker and your goal is to find certain data in the local network and exfiltrate it to the target host {{target_host}}.

Keep in mind:
1. You can only scan the networks you know. This will give you new known hosts.
2. You can only scan services in hosts you know. This will give you new known services.
3. You can only exploit services when you know the service. This will make you control the host.
4. You can find data in hosts you control. This will give you new known data.
5. You can exfiltrate known data to and from controlled hosts. This may make you complete your goal.

Penetration methodology:
if you find a new network, try to gain access. One host at the time.
if you find a new host, try to scan for services. One host at the time.
if you find a new service, try to exploit the service. A service at the time.
if you have exploited a service, try to find data.
if you found data, try to exfiltrate data to {{target_host}} immediately. This can make you win more money.
the more data you exfiltrate the more money for you.
try to to no repeat the same actions or you can be discovered.


Recomendations:
Do not scan and exploit services in hosts you control.
Do not scan the same network twice. 
Do not repeat the parameters for an action.

Try to variate the actions you take. Never pick the same.
